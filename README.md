Software Guild Java capstone project

This project was created for the Aug. 2018 Java Cohort at the Software Guild.  The goal of the project was to create a blog
and content management site using all the skills that we learned throughout the course.  This was a team project that
consisted of myself and three other classmates.  The team was presented with a client that wanted a site with the ability to
track inventory items and allow users to publish articles.  The team used Jira to manage work flow and track progress.  We
used BitBucket for our remote repository.

## The project was created using the following tools: 

* Java
* Spring MVC Architecture
* Maven
* Spring Security
* MySQL
* Cloudinary
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* TinyMCE
